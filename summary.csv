We have flexible working hours and a culture based on respect, trust and collaboration.
WHY WE'RE DIFFERENT
You know, work doesn't have to feel like work. In fact, we don't want it to. That's why we've cultivated an environment based on creativity. Because when people who care about their craft are given the freedom to explore possibilities without
            restriction, amazing things can happen.
OUR CULTURE
No cool cliques, just hard-working humans generating ideas and devising solutions in a creative, collaborative work space. Professional but not corporate, we believe success is achieved through strong leadership (without interference from middle-management)
            and an autonomous working environment backed by the moral support of like-minded peers. This is a highly collaborative, supportive environment.
VERSENT VALUES AND BEHAVIOURS

People: We believe in a positive team with family spirit, because life is to short for anything else.
Customer: We create remarkable experiences for customers and treat them as you would wish to be treated.
Quality: Be Artisans who care for their craft and lead change through continuous improvement.
Reliability: Do what we say we will do when we say we will do it, every time.
Transparency: Full disclosure, integrity and honesty in all things.
Reciprocate: Give back and assist as much as possible, whenever possible.

About ME
We’re not like other banks.
 
ME was created by the industry super funds to be different from the pack ­– and we’re passionate about staying that way as we head into an exciting and progressive future.
 
We are building a bank, a company and a brand that we can be proud of – but to achieve that, we need the best people. To help ME get there, you’ll challenge the status quo and share extraordinary ideas – and our size guarantees you’ll have the
          opportunity, support, and environment to be heard.
 
ME’s core purpose is helping all Australians get ahead – no conditions, asterisks or exceptions.
 
We believe everyone deserves the same opportunities in life, regardless of gender or identity, sexuality, ethnicity, disability or religion. This is why we’re so committed to an equal opportunity workplace – because we know our success won’t
          come from focusing on similarities, but by embracing and celebrating our diversity.
 
A little bit about the role
We are at the start of an exciting digital journey so it is a great start to join ME! We are seeking a Data Engineer who enjoys rolling up their sleeves, learning and growing. As part of our Enterprise Data Team, you will ensure fit for purpose
          data warehouse solutions are built for use across the bank and by utilising best practise ETL standards, you’ll ensure the data is trusted by our BI developers and key business consumers, oh, and you’ll get to work on Microsoft technology stack
          too.
 
You will be involved with investigating data issues, keeping data feeds flowing and collaborating with different projects across the bank to deliver quality data solutions. How important does that sound? There is also the opportunity to move around
          and what’s really sensational is you will be working on cutting edge technologies and building a data warehouse from the ground up.
 
Let’s chat about you
You’re naturally a highly motivated and energetic person who thrives in a dynamic, collaborative team environment.  Ideally you have previous experience as an ETL developer, Data Engineer or a BI developer, and if you have a degree in computer
          science or similar it would really put you ahead of the rest.
 
With your knowledge of SQL coding language, Microsoft technologies and understanding of warehouse concepts, plus having worked with data teams before, you’re ready to expand your horizons and launch your career into the world of IT at ME.
 
About the perks
 At ME, we believe that work should be a place that you can make the most of – and these are just some of the many reasons why people love it here:
 

Popular culture – that’s not a claim, we’ve got the data to prove it. We genuinely care about each other and work in an encouraging and collaborative environment.
The whole package – sure, we’re going to reward you well with your salary package – but there are also lots of other perks – including free health support, conveniently-located offices, plus much more.
Not afraid to fail? We embrace action-oriented people like you. That’s right, you can make mistakes here and it’s ok – so long as you learn from them.
To be ME, we need you – we’re building something really cool and you get to directly influence what that is.
ProudlyME – our internal pride network – has a swag of initiatives that show support, education, and passion toward our team and customers, demonstrating that ME is a strong advocate on equal rights for the LGBTIQ+ community.
Meet the Execs – our Executive team is fun and full of passion because we know great managers mean happy staff.

 
Oh, and did we mention you get your very own ME branded Converse High-top shoes? Now that’s a reason to get your foot in the door.
 
I was born to play this role
 Can’t see a closing date on the advert? That’s because we’re pretty efficient here at ME and we may start looking at applications sooner rather than later, so if this role sounds like your jam, be sure to apply by submitting your resume
          today.

Children’s Medical Research Institute (CMRI) was Australia’s first dedicated paediatric research facility and is now one of the world’s most highly regarded independent medical research centres.  Our research focuses on the areas of embryonic
          development and birth defects, cancer, neuroscience and gene therapy and we have a strong international reputation based on our research outcomes.  It is also home to the world-first proteomics project, ProCan, which is changing the way
          cancer is diagnosed and treated. CMRI’s research programs are supported by state of the art facilities and committed research and support staff. Our achievements are made possible by a loyal network of community supporters, highly engaged donors
          and the very successful Jeans for Genes® fundraising campaign. 
 
A data scientist position is available in the ProCan Cancer Data Science Group, led by Dr. Qing Zhong. ProCan (the ACRF International Centre for the Proteome of Human Cancer) is a world-first initiative developed and launched in September 2016
          by Professors Phil Robinson and Roger Reddel, and established with a $10 million grant from the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF). Equipped with six SCIEX mass spectrometers and a super computer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan processes
          tumour samples through a proteomic method, SWATH-MS, which allows fast mass spectrometric conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a single, permanent digital file representing the quantitative proteome of the sample. One of
          the goals of ProCan is to measure thousands of proteins in about 70,000 cancers of all types with known treatment outcome and correlate tumour proteotypes with clinical phenotypes. The Cancer Data Science Group aims to develop novel computational
          tools and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses of the group are 1) big proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-proteome association analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying
          cancer, 3) development of advanced statistical tools to account for batch effects caused by large-scale, high throughput proteomics, and 4) implementation of big data-driven, evidence-based computational tools to achieve predictive, preventive,
          personalized medicine.
We invite applications from PhD scientists to join our group. Applicants should have a high degree of motivation in academic research, an excellent record of scientific accomplishments with publications in peer-reviewed journals, and the ability
